Goal:
    The goal of the Workout Analyzer is to provide the means to track progress over time
    The progress includes:
        Information per:
            - Workout
            - exercise
        Information tracked/computed:
            - weight
            - reps
            - weight increase over time
            - repetition increase over time
            - rest change between exercises over time (need to support rest tracking)
            - weight/reps as related to:
                - workout order (e.g. chest > legs > shoulders, in theory shoulders should be stronger than in chest > shoudlers)
                - workout start time (need to add time support, can add in title)
                    - morning workouts in theory should be lower weights/more reps (or plain cardio)
                    - afternoon/evening workouts in theory should be higher weights
                - workout duration (need to support duration, can add in title)
                    - how does longer duration affect the workout
                    - how does shorter duration affect the workout
                - exercise rest (need to support rest)
                - how does the workout duration affect consecutive workouts 
                    - longer workouts could tire you more, leading to lower performance in consecutive workouts

    Means to export to:
        - CSV
        - excel spreadsheet
    Means to graph data:
        - using matlab
        - some other plotting library
